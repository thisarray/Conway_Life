# Conway's Game of Life
In [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life),
the following rules are applied in each generation (turn):

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die.

A neighbor is defined as any adjacent cell horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
